The solution works because it properly implements all the components needed for a CMake-based library to be discoverable and usable through `find_package()`. Let me explain how each part contributes to making it work:

### 1. **Library Versioning**
```cmake
set_target_properties(myalloc PROPERTIES
    VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION}
    SOVERSION 1
)
```
- `VERSION`: Sets the full library version (1.0.0 format)
- `SOVERSION`: Sets the ABI version (for binary compatibility)
- This creates properly versioned library files (`libmyalloc.so.1.0.0`, `libmyalloc.so.1` symlink)

### 2. **Installation Targets**
```cmake
install(TARGETS myalloc
    EXPORT myallocTargets
    LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
    ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
    PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION include/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```
- Installs:
  - Shared library to `lib/`
  - Static library (if any) to `lib/`
  - Public headers to `include/my_alloc/`

### 3. **Target Export**
```cmake
install(EXPORT myallocTargets
    FILE myallocTargets.cmake
    NAMESPACE myalloc::
    DESTINATION lib/cmake/myalloc
)
```
- Creates a `myallocTargets.cmake` file that:
  - Defines the `myalloc::myalloc` imported target
  - Includes all dependencies (Threads in this case)
  - Sets proper include paths and linking information

### 4. **Package Configuration**
```cmake
configure_package_config_file(...)
write_basic_package_version_file(...)
install(FILES ...)
```
- Generates two critical files:
  1. `myallocConfig.cmake`: Main package configuration
  2. `myallocConfigVersion.cmake`: Version compatibility checking

### 5. **Config File Template (`myallocConfig.cmake.in`)**
```cmake
@PACKAGE_INIT@
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/myallocTargets.cmake")
```
- Provides the entry point for `find_package()`
- Includes the exported targets file
- Handles any required dependencies

### **Why It Works Now**

1. **Complete Installation**: All necessary files are installed to standard locations:
   - Binary: `/usr/local/lib/libmyalloc.so.1.0.0`
   - Headers: `/usr/local/include/my_alloc/`
   - Config files: `/usr/local/lib/cmake/myalloc/`

2. **Proper Target Export**: The exported target (`myalloc::myalloc`) contains:
   - Library path
   - Include directories
   - Dependencies (Threads)
   - Compile definitions and options

3. **Version Handling**: The version files ensure compatibility checking works:
   ```cmake
   find_package(myalloc 1.0 REQUIRED) # Will fail if version < 1.0
   ```

4. **Relocatable Paths**: All paths in config files are relative or use variables like `@PACKAGE_INIT@` which makes the package work regardless of installation prefix.

### **Usage Flow**

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
   cmake --build build
   sudo cmake --install build
   ```

2. **Finding the Package**:
   ```cmake
   find_package(myalloc REQUIRED)
   # This loads myallocConfig.cmake which:
   # 1. Checks version compatibility
   # 2. Includes myallocTargets.cmake
   # 3. Creates myalloc::myalloc target
   ```

3. **Linking**:
   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE myalloc::myalloc)
   # Automatically handles:
   # - Library linking
   # - Include directories
   # - Compile definitions
   # - Transitive dependencies (Threads)
   ```

### **Key Improvements Over Initial Version**

1. **Namespace Usage**: `myalloc::myalloc` prevents name collisions
2. **Proper Versioning**: Prevents ABI incompatibility issues
3. **Complete Installation**: No missing files during `find_package()`
4. **Relocatable**: Works regardless of installation prefix
5. **Dependency Handling**: Threads requirement is properly forwarded

The CMake configuration files installed in `/usr/local/lib/cmake/<package-name>/` (or equivalent system directories) serve several critical roles in making your library properly discoverable and usable through CMake's `find_package()` mechanism. Here's a detailed breakdown of their purpose and functionality:

### Core Files Typically Found in `lib/cmake/<package-name>/`:

1. **`<package>Config.cmake`**
   - Primary package configuration file
   - Defines all imported targets (e.g., `myalloc::myalloc`)
   - Sets up include paths, compiler flags, and dependencies
   - Created via `configure_package_config_file()` in your CMakeLists

2. **`<package>ConfigVersion.cmake`**
   - Handles version compatibility checking
   - Generated by `write_basic_package_version_file()`
   - Ensures `find_package()` version requirements are met

3. **`<package>Targets.cmake`**
   - Contains the actual target definitions
   - Generated by `install(EXPORT ...)`
   - Includes absolute paths to libraries and headers

### Key Roles These Files Serve:

1. **Package Discovery**  
   When you call `find_package(myalloc)`, CMake searches standard paths including:
   - `/usr/local/lib/cmake/`
   - `/usr/lib/cmake/`
   - Paths in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`

2. **Target Provisioning**  
   The files create imported targets (like `myalloc::myalloc`) that contain:
   ```cmake
   # Example generated content:
   add_library(myalloc::myalloc SHARED IMPORTED)
   set_target_properties(myalloc::myalloc PROPERTIES
     INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "/usr/local/include/my_alloc"
     IMPORTED_LOCATION "/usr/local/lib/libmyalloc.so.1.0"
     INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES "Threads::Threads"
   )
   ```

3. **Dependency Propagation**  
   They automatically handle transitive dependencies (like `Threads` in your case)

4. **Version Management**  
   The version file ensures compatibility checks:
   ```cmake
   find_package(myalloc 1.2 REQUIRED) # Will fail if version < 1.2
   ```

5. **Relocatable Paths**  
   Modern config files use relative paths through special tokens like `@PACKAGE_INIT@`

### How They Work Together:

1. **`find_package()` Flow**:
   ```
   find_package(myalloc)
     → Finds ConfigVersion.cmake
        → Checks version compatibility
     → Loads Config.cmake
        → Processes dependencies
        → Includes Targets.cmake
           → Creates imported targets
   ```

2. **File Relationships**:
   ```mermaid
   graph TD
     A[ConfigVersion.cmake] -->|Version check| B[Config.cmake]
     B -->|Includes| C[Targets.cmake]
     C -->|Creates| D[Imported Targets]
   ```

### Why They're in `lib/cmake/`:

1. **Standard CMake Convention**  
   CMake always checks `lib/cmake/` when searching for packages

2. **Separation of Concerns**  
   - Binary libraries go in `lib/`
   - Configuration metadata goes in `lib/cmake/`

3. **Multi-Arch Support**  
   On multi-arch systems (like Ubuntu), this helps maintain:
   - `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/`
   - `/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/cmake/`

### Debugging Tips:

If `find_package()` fails, check:
1. File existence:
   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/lib/cmake/myalloc/
   # Should show:
   # myallocConfig.cmake
   # myallocConfigVersion.cmake
   # myallocTargets.cmake
   ```
2. File contents:
   ```bash
   cat /usr/local/lib/cmake/myalloc/myallocTargets.cmake
   # Verify paths point to valid locations
   ```
3. Search paths:
   ```cmake
   message(STATUS "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: ${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}")
   message(STATUS "CMAKE_MODULE_PATH: ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}")
   ```
