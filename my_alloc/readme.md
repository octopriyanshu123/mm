# Custom Memory Allocation Library
## **Overview**
The `my_alloc` project aims to implement a custom memory allocation library that offers fine-grained control over memory management, file I/O, inter-process communication (IPC), garbage collection, and more. The goal is to create a highly flexible, efficient, and scalable allocator with custom memory management techniques.

## **Features and Implementation**

### 1. **Memory Allocation Using `sbrk` and `brk`**
   - **Purpose**: Implement a memory allocator similar to `malloc`/`free` using `sbrk` and `brk` system calls to manage the program's heap.
   - **Challenges**: 
     - `sbrk` is deprecated on some platforms.
     - Fragmentation management.
     - Efficient block management.
     - Implement memory allocation using `sbrk` (or `mmap` as an alternative).
     - Consider using **buddy allocation**, **first-fit**, or **best-fit** strategies to reduce fragmentation.
     - Track allocated and free blocks using **free lists**.

---

### 2. **Free Memory After Use (Delete Memory)**
   - **Purpose**: Implement a `free()` function to release memory back to the system after use.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Handling fragmentation and reusing freed blocks.
     - Safely managing errors like double-free or invalid free.
     - Use a **linked list** or **free list** to manage free memory blocks.
     - Implement **safety checks** (e.g., double-free detection).
     - Merge adjacent free blocks to reduce fragmentation.

---

### 3. **File I/O: Reading and Writing Data Using a Buffer**
   - **Purpose**: Implement buffered reading and writing of data from/to files.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Efficient buffering to minimize system calls.
     - Handling large files.
     - Use **circular buffers** for continuous read/write operations.
     - Implement **memory-mapped files** (`mmap`) for large files to directly map them into memory, improving performance.
     - Implement **flushing** to ensure data integrity on crash or program exit.

---

### 4. **IPC: Shared Memory Region in RAM**
   - **Purpose**: Implement shared memory in RAM for inter-process communication (IPC).
   - **Challenges**:
     - Memory access synchronization across processes.
     - Preventing race conditions.
     - Use **POSIX shared memory** (`shm_open`, `mmap`) or **System V shared memory** (`shmget`, `shmat`).
     - Implement synchronization using **mutexes** or **semaphores** to ensure safe access.
     - Provide an API for easy memory allocation and deallocation in shared memory.

---

### 5. **Track Memory Usage in the Heap**
   - **Purpose**: Track allocated memory and monitor heap usage.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Efficient memory tracking without introducing overhead.
     - Managing fragmented memory.
     - Maintain **metadata** for each allocated block (e.g., size, status).
     - Use a **linked list** or **bitmap** to track the status of each block in the heap.
     - Implement debugging tools for memory fragmentation statistics.

---

### 6. **Garbage Collector**
   - **Purpose**: Automatically manage and reclaim memory by detecting and freeing unused objects.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Potential conflicts with custom allocators and manual memory management.
     - Performance overhead introduced by garbage collection.
     - Implement **mark-and-sweep** or **reference counting** garbage collection.
     - Consider **generational garbage collection** to optimize performance.
     - Implement **weak references** for objects that should not be kept alive by the garbage collector.

---

### 7. **Swap Data from Stack to Heap (and vice versa)**
   - **Purpose**: Allow data to be dynamically moved between the stack and the heap.
   - **Challenges**:
     - Managing memory ownership and ensuring safe access.
     - Potential conflicts with stack-based memory (automatic) and heap-based memory (manual).
     - Dynamically allocate memory on the heap and copy stack data to it.
     - Track **ownership** to ensure proper cleanup.
     - Handle memory access **safely** (e.g., using smart pointers or reference counting).

---

### **Features**

#### 1. **Thread Safety**
   - Ensure that the allocator is thread-safe when used in multi-threaded environments.
  
- Use **mutexes** or **locks** to synchronize memory access in multi-threaded applications.
- Consider using **lock-free data structures** or **atomic operations** to reduce contention.

#### 2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize the memory allocator for performance, reducing overhead and fragmentation.
- Implement **benchmarking tools** to test performance under various scenarios.
- Profile memory usage and fragmentation, and experiment with **block size** tuning.
- Consider using **slab allocation** for objects of fixed sizes to speed up allocation.

#### 3. **Memory Leak Detection**
   - Implement a tool to detect memory leaks in programs using your allocator.
- Keep track of all allocated blocks and check for any unfreed memory at program exit.
- Provide **error messages** or warnings if memory is not freed properly.
- Use **debugging tools** to inspect memory allocation patterns and detect leaks.

#### 4. **Integration with Standard Allocators**
   - Integrate with standard allocators (like `malloc`/`free`) for seamless memory management.
- Override system memory functions using **preload libraries** or **dynamic linking** (`dlopen`/`dlsym`).
- Ensure compatibility with existing C/C++ programs using standard allocators.
  
#### 5. **Documentation and Debugging Tools**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation for your memory allocator, and tools to assist with debugging.
- Provide detailed usage documentation for all features and API functions.
- Implement a **logging mechanism** to track memory allocations, deallocations, and errors.
- Create a **visualization tool** for monitoring heap usage and fragmentation over time.
