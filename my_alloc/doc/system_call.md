The sbrk() function in C is used to dynamically increase or decrease the amount of memory allocated to a process's data segment (heap) by adding a specified number of bytes to the current "break" value, which marks the end of the data segment. 


Purpose:
sbrk() is a system call (or a C library wrapper around a system call) that allows a program to request more memory from the operating system for its data segment. 
How it works:
It takes an argument incr (an integer representing the number of bytes to add or subtract). 
It adds incr to the current "break" value, which determines the end of the data segment. 
If incr is positive, the data segment grows; if negative, it shrinks (though shrinking is not always guaranteed to succeed). 
It returns a pointer to the start of the newly allocated memory (or the prior break value if incr is 0). 
Return Value:
On success, sbrk() returns the prior break value. 
On failure (e.g., if there's not enough memory), it returns (void *) -1 and sets errno to indicate the error. 
Relationship to brk():
The brk() function is related to sbrk(), but it sets the break value directly to a given address, while sbrk() adds to the current break value. 
Modern Alternatives:
While sbrk() was a common way to manage memory allocation in older systems, modern systems often use mmap() for memory mapping, which provides more flexibility and control over memory allocation.
